Quote.css
=========


Quote.css is a little <acronym title="Cascading Style Sheet">CSS</acronym> file that holds all different quotation mark signs for different languages. The language should already be set in the `html` tag, but can also be set for specific text passages by adding a language attribute to the containing element, e.g:

    <p lang="en-US">
      <q><q>This is a quote.</q>, he said.</q>, she said.
    </p>
